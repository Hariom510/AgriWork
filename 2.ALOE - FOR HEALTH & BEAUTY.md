## Aloe as an ornamental plant
Aloe is a delight for eyes and adds beauty to gardens. It is a succulent and sun loving plant and a best choice for rock gardens. Aloe can tolerate a wide range of temperature and thrive even in poor soil. As a potted plant, it can live for many years without repotting and grows well even without much care. Interestingly, Aloe is one of the air purifying plants recommended by NASA and hence a best choice as indoor plant. Potting mixture for Aloe can be prepared by mixing two parts of loam with one-part coarse sand, brick pieces and crushed limestone along with a pinch of bonemeal. Being a succulent, it hates over watering i.e., it needs water occasionally only just to prevent the shriveling of leaves. New plants are grown usually from slips (plantlets arising around the base of the old plant) and sometimes from stem sections. Flowering and seed production occurs in dry arid regions but rarely in humid areas.
## Aloe as a vegetable
The pads of sweet Aloe type are used as vegetable and for preparing pickles, salads, confectionaries etc. In both sweet and bitter types, the immature inflorescences are free of bitterness and hence suited for vegetable purpose. Plant juice is an ideal nutritional supplement.
