## INTRODUCTION
Landraces are the primitive cultivars which are believed to be originated from the process of domestication without any systematic and sustainable breeding efforts. Landraces are highly variable crop populations that have been selected and cultivated by farmers to adapt to local environments and meet various needs. An important characteristic of landraces is that they display considerable genetic variation as compared to improved varieties. Besides good grain and straw quality genes, nature has bestowed these populations the ability or capacity to cope with new coming challenges and other socio-economic issues as they are reservoirs of useful genes having wider adaptability, wide resilience against many kinds of abiotic and biotic stresses such as cold, drought, insect pests and diseases. Plant breeders can use this variation to improve crop’s resistance to stresses like cold, drought, heat and continuously evolving pests and diseases to increase yield directly thus meet the needs of increasing population. However, despite being the richest repositories of genetic diversity, source of valuable genes and unique resources for food security, they are becoming more threatened and suffering from genetic erosion. Therefore, there is need to conserve landraces because decrease in crop genetic diversity poses a risk to food security in the future, especially in light of a growing human population. The systematic, coordinated and integrated in situ (where the plant is continually grown, managed and harvested in its original agricultural environment) and ex situ conservation (where seeds, plants, plant parts, tissues or cells are preserved in an artificial environment. The most common form of ex-situ conservation is through storage of material in gene-banks. The seeds are typically stored in laminated packets which are placed in containers and kept frozen at -18°C. The conservationist has to work closely together with farmers in order to manage and monitor their landrace populations aiming at the long term preservation by maintaining genetic richness and evenness of the landrace diversity.
Maize or corn (Zea mays) is derived from the ancient word mahiz from the Taino language. It is a plant belonging to the family of grasses (Poaceae). The miracle of maize’s birth is widely debated in science. Scientists believe people living in Central Mexico Balsas River Valley developed corn at least 8,700 years ago (from where maize  spread to other non-traditional areas and even to temperate belts of world and got established as a new crop). However, it is agreed that teosinte (a type of grass) is one of its genetic ancestors. What is unique is that maize’s evolution advanced at the hands of farmers. Ancient Mesoamerican farmers realized this genetic mutation of teosinte. Through generations of selective breeding based on the varying preferences of farmers and influenced by different climates and geography, maize evolved into a plant species full of diversity.
Maize is cultivated globally being one of the most important cereal crops worldwide. The United States, China, Brazil and Mexico account for 70% of global production. India has 5% of corn acreage and contributes 2% of world production. Maize is not only an important human nutrient, but also a basic element of animal feed and raw material for manufacture of many industrial products. The products include corn starch, maltodextrins, corn oil, corn syrup and products of fermentation and distillation industries. It is also being recently used as biofuel.
In the state of Jammu and Kashmir particularly in Kashmir division, maize is the second most important crop after rice. It is a staple food of some tribal areas of Poonch, Rajouri, Bandipora, Badarwah etc. where nomadic people such as Gujar and Bakarwall mainly depends on maize. In Kashmir, maize is grown as a sole crop at an altitude range of 1850-2300m above mean sea level. Generally maize is grown as rainfed crop on marginal lands particularly in hilly terrains of the Kashmir valley at longitude and latitude of 73.0-76.2E and 32.50-36.0N respectively. However, it is also found to occupy plain belts of the valley in few pockets where irrigation facility is either absent or inconvenient. In the plain belts of the valley (1450-1650 m amsl) maize is usually grown as backyard /kitchen garden crop where maize plants are not allowed to go to seed development. The crop is usually consumed just before dough stage as roasted or boiled cob.
The maize landraces are usually genetically heterogeneous populations (such population comprising a mixture of genotypes), and are typically selected by farmers for better adaptation to specific environment, prolificacy, flowering behaviour, yield, nutritive value and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses.; The ear type is usually maintained by the farmers through conservative selection in spite of considerable gene flow. In addition to farmer’s management of maize landraces (e.g. sample size, selection decisions), the biology of the species (e.g. cross-pollination in case of maize) also plays a major role in structuring the maize populations 
There has been significant decrease in maize genetic diversity in the last few decades due to replacement of maize landraces at a faster rate by cultivation of modern hybrids and by adopting modern agricultural systems. The use of a limited number of elite lines and synthetics heightens the risk of genetic uniformity in commercial maize production fields. Thus, maize breeders became more aware of the need for both maintaining genetic diversity among hybrid varieties and improving the management of genetic resources through the conservation of landraces. However, little impact was realized in Kashmir valley in the form of area enhancement under these modern varieties. The most important reason behind the fact was that hybrids are developed for more favourable environments which add non significant gain in the marginal environment. The expensive seed cost further aggravate the situation. In some cases diminishing returns were realized because of their poor adaptability under cold temperate conditions of Kashmir. Some landrace populations of maize are still popular among the farmers of Kashmir because of their some desirable traits. Farmers are growing landraces from early times either as a sole crop or in some cases intercropped with pulse crops such as beans, green gram etc. to increase the cropping intensity. The farmers go for intercropping because through traditional knowledge system they know the positive impact on compatibility of two crops and soil health aspect. A number of landrace populations of maize have been documented from Kashmir valley but presently few are in the farmer’s domain.

## Reasons of their Popularity
The main reasons of their popularity even in the circumstances of availability of high yielding varieties bred by public and private sector are:
- Good adaptation: Their adaptation to specific agro-ecologies and have usually assumed a niche status. They have very good population buffering.
-	Wide resistance to natural factors: These land race populations have wide range of genetic variability and adaptability. They possess the genes for tolerance to various biotic and abiotic stresses. Most important to mention are drought, cold, insect, pest resistance etc.
- They are early maturing and thus vacate the field early and escape the cold injury risk at later stages of crop growth. Snowfall is likely to be expected in the month of September particularly in the hilly terrains when the crop is under dough stage.
- very good culm quality usually thin and succulent stems are highly relished by the cattle in the lean season when there is no other fodder crop available.
-	As maize is grown usually on marginal lands and under low input environment and the areas where irrigation facility is absent. Since these landraces have much specific adaptability, they thrive best even under low input conditions. Known, locally-adapted, open-pollinated maize with its more variable flowering times is often a "safer" crop under marginal farming conditions.
-	Good grain quality: Because of very good grain quality they are mostly preferred over hybrids and synthetics bred by Mountain Crop Research Station (SKUAST-K) meant for the purpose for different agro-ecologies of Kashmir and from outside sources of equivalent ecologies.
- Food and fodder value: These land races usually serve as a staple food of 15% of the population of Kashmir valley. The maize kernels are ground to fine flour (locally called Makai atta). The unleavened bread is finally prepared of this flour which is much liked by the local people even the rice consumers of Kashmir. The bread is usually supplemented with locally prepared ghee which adds taste and aroma to the unleavened bread. The byproduct of the grinding process is rough maize flour (locally called Satoo) and is consumed with salt tea. It is used throughout Kashmir valley as a breakfast food and is cheaper alternative to bread. In some cases maize is consumed just like rice. After boiling maize grains a sticky dish is prepared and is supplemented with curd. This is highly relished by elderly people in the hilly areas and locally called makai wart. In the local system of medicine it is recommended to diabetic patients and those having urinary problems. Satoo (rough flour) used as breakfast food, Atta (fine flour) for bread making and Makai wart (boiled kernals of maize just like rice).
-	The roasted and boiled cobs of local land races fetch a very good market rate because of very high taste and good sugary content. When fodder values of these landraces are concerned, their thin and succulent stems (culm) are highly relished by cattle and do not leave any part of it unconsumed. Since during winter the valley remains cut off for months together from outer part of the world and these hilly terrains have no alternative except to use maize stover as cattle fodder.
- Conservation of biodiversity: Since farmers are continuously growing these landraces over years, they are conserving and utilizing the maize biodiversity.
- Resistance against climate change: Landraces of maize are best weapons to combat the challenge of climate change. These cultures conserve the tremendous genetic variability which can serve as wealth for overcoming future challenges like new biotic and abiotic stresses in the scenario of climate change. There shall remain no weapon, besides these allelic resources for the crop development. 
These landraces with so many potentials are losing their popularity and are gradually going out of farmers’ domain and becoming extinct. These are facing a tough competition from newly developed hybrids and synthetic varieties. The main reasons of losing the farmer’s expectations and few challenges before these erstwhile popular landraces are:
- Low yielding potential: Since maize landraces populations are generally low yielders when compared top modern varieties. As a result they are being replaced by high yielding hybrids and synthetic varieties although at a slow rate.
-	Low resilience to some biotic stresses: These farmers varieties are showing low or no resistance to worldly famous maize diseases such as Turcicum leaf blight and common rust which are taking a heavy toll of the crop. In disease favourable years there is significant damage in terms of low yield production and reduction in straw quality.
-	Lower sensitivity to inputs:- These land races are highly stable and well adapted under specific agro-ecologies. These respond at a very slow rate to favourable environments and to costlier inputs such as inorganic and bio-fertilizers.
-	Socio economic plight of the farmers: - People engaged with maize production are resource poor farmers and are socially and economically backward. They are not growing their landraces on modern scientific lines. It is the need of hour to conserve these maize landrace populations. There is much probability of these maize cultivars to become extinct by the very near future. A big challenge before plant breeders is therefore to collect conserve, and utilize these populations so as to get themselves prepared for forthcoming challenges.
## Utility of Maize Landraces in Crop Improvement
The utilization of genetic diversity of landraces in breeding programs started with development of the first inbred lines in Yugoslavia form Ruma Golden Dent, Vukovar Dent, Šidski, Beljski and Novi Sad Golden Dent populations. Crosses of self pollinated landraces with American inbred lines, which expressed a high level of heterosis, were the base for development of line-hybrids. First Yugoslav maize hybrids were created from inbred lines of local origin and foreign inbred lines genetically divergent from local germplasm. In modern maize breeding program landraces are used for creation of broad base synthetic populations, development of core collections and as potential sources of favourable traits.
## Agronomic performance:
Characterization of genetic diversity of maize landraces is due to efficient allelic variation  necessary for genetic improvement of economically desirable traits, such as grain quality. Maize is a relevant food source, so the quantification of the nutritionally important grain constituents is the need of the hour  for the best exploitation of different genotypes. In this context, the landraces represent a good source of genetic variability and may help to identify the most suitable materials for the development of more nutritious foods. Many studies have documented genetic and phenotypic variability for grain composition traits in maize. Promising maize landraces with highest concentration of lutein, zeaxanthin and B- Carotene (precursor of Vitamin A) have been identified at the Institute for Agrobotany, Hungry and they are being utilized as a source material to transfer these valuable traits in improved elite hybrids and inbreds.

## Drought tolerance:
Drought can be defined as the absence of adequate moisture necessary for normal plant growth and to complete the life cycle. It is a “single most common cause of severe food shortage” (FAO) in developing countries and predicted global warming will increase drought impact on crop production. Drought tolerance is the most difficult task for maize breeders to be solved. It is polygenic and complex trait with high genotype x environment interaction. Moreover, this stress occurs randomly in timing and severity, making identification of drought tolerant genotypes more difficult. Genetic Diversity of Maize Landraces as sources of drought tolerance were evolved and examined by CIMMYT for use in maize breeding programs and traits like flowering date anthesis-silking interval, ears per plant (barenness), leaf rolling, tassel size and stay green are  of critical importance for maize improvement under drought situations.
## Source of Male Sterility:
Absence of pollen and plant inability to produce functional pollen grains is known as male sterility. Male sterility can be determined by nuclear (genetic male sterility) or cytoplasmic (cytoplasmic genetic male sterility – CGMS) genes. CGMS (onwards referred to as CMS) is successfully used in commercial production of hybrid seed, avoiding the drawbacks of hand or mechanical emasculation. Identification of CMS types is important because commercial production of maize hybrid seed today stands upon utilization of C and S cytoplasmic types, as self-pollination in plants can severely jeopardize its production. Detasseling (removal of flowers from maize plants by hand) can be replaced by introducing male sterility in maize. This reduces possibility of self-pollination and also saves seed producers millions of dollars per year in labour costs. Three main types of CMS were identified in maize: CMS-T, CMS-S and CMS-C. Male sterile cytoplasm is distinguished by specific nuclear genes (Rf genes) that restore pollen fertility. These genes, restorers of fertility, suppress the male-sterile effect of the cytoplasm, allowing the production of viable pollen. The use of uniform materials can be a threat in crop production and genetic vulnerability must be a constant concern in plant breeding for all species. An example is the extensive use of CMS-T in 1950s and 1960s, which showed to be extremely susceptible to Helminthosporium maydis race T. Severe yield losses occurred in the United States and other regions of the world in 1970s, due to the Helminthosporium maydis pandemic. For new CMS sources landrace genotypes worldwide were searched and one source was found within Maize Research Institute gene bank collection. Tester lines containing nuclear Rf genes are traditionally used for identification and classification of CMS types.
Collection and evaluation of maize land races are basic to maize improvement programs for sustainable agriculture. Adequate characterization for agronomic and morphological traits is necessary to facilitate utilization of landraces by breeders. To achieve this, landraces of maize need to be characterized for morphological, agronomic and other stress related traits of interest. There exists a wide genetic variability in maize, making process of selection promising for traits of economic importance.
## Improvement of maize landrace populations
- Since landraces are having wide genetic variability the genetic enhancement for yield and other morpho-agronomic traits can simply be obtained by mass selection. Few selection cycles can give a significant genetic gain over the base population. Thus various economic traits can be improved through this method.
- Population improvement programme: Few simple recurrent selection cycles can improve the base population of these landraces because they possess broad spectrum genetic variability within the population for various economic traits. This not only improves the population per se but improved inbreds can be derived from the populations for hybrid development.
- Biotechnological interventions: Few economic traits available in maize landraces can be rectified by using the latest tool of biotechnology such as molecular selections and other tools. The current revolution in DNA technologies offers tremendous opportunities to understand the genetic relationships and diversity among maize landraces and improved cultivars. Molecular-marker-based diversity assessment has provided valuable information on the extent and distribution of genetic diversity in global maize germplasm. Next-generation sequencing and high density genotyping technologies, including GBS, will provide greater insights into the structure and organization of maize genome, and speed up the discovery and use of new and useful alleles available in maize landraces for maize improvement. Additionally, intensive and concerted efforts (e.g. LAMP and US-GEM) are needed for a better understanding of the breeding value of the maize genetic resources available worldwide including landraces.
- Innovative approaches for crop improvement: - New scientific management technologies can be popularized in the farming community like proper crop husbandry practices for better production which in turn can improve socioeconomic plight of the farmers.
- Participating plant breeding (PPB) approaches: PPB will work with farmers aspirations and needs and develop the varieties as per the priorities of clients. This is because in formal breeding programme varieties are generally developed at favourable environments but are proposed for different environments. The released variety is in real practice not in multiplication chain and is thus not available. The expensive cost and long lag phase from development of variety and actual availability to farmers also play a role in slow adoption of good varieties. The resource poor farmers particularly in maize are generally locatedin  marginal environments and such conditions are not being given due consideration. It is here that these landraces can be popularized after genetic enhancement and genetic purification in the farmers fields. The community seed production units can be established for informal seed multiplication chain. Thus participatory role is needed where farmers can be directly involved and agro-ecology specific varieties can be designed. This will economize time and resources viz-a-viz maintaining the maize genetic diversity in-situ.
