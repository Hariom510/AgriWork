# ROLE OF EPIGENETIC REGULATION IN PLANT DISEASE RESISTANCE
## ABSTRACT 
The study of epigenetics in plants has a long and rich history, from initial descriptions of non-mendelian gene behaviours to seminal discoveries of chromatin-modifying proteins and RNAs that mediate gene silencing in most eukaryotes, including humans. Epigenetics is a discipline that studies heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve altering the DNA sequence.
Epigenetic factors have recently emerged as key regulators of the defense response to pathogens in plants. The main epigenetic mechanisms include the well understood phenomenon of DNA methylation, histone modification, and small RNA regulation, a mode of regulation that has only been identified relatively recently and is an area of intensive ongoing investigation and other epigenetic regulatory mechanisms also involved in disease resistance. The diversity of epigenetic pathways in plants is remarkable, presumably contributing to the phenotypic plasticity of plant postembryonic development and the ability to survive and reproduce in unpredictable environments.

## Introduction:
Epigenetics is defined as mechanisms that regulate gene expression without base sequence alteration. In 1942, C.H. Waddington coined the term epigenetics to mean above or in addition to genetics to explain differentiation. He defined it as “Branch of Biology which studies causal interaction between genes and their products, which bring the phenotype in to being”. Usually this means information coded beyond the DNA sequence, such as in covalent modifications to the DNA or modifications to the chromatin structure. Practically, epigenetics describes phenomena in which genetically identical cells or organisms express their genomes differently, causing phenotypic differences. Epigenetics is differing from genetics it will be potentially stable and heritable nature. Epigenetics save as a memory in a plant. During the time of stress through that memory epigenetic regulation will occur in the plant and also stimulated the defense reaction against the stress. In this study revealed that exploring the role of epigenetic regulation in plant disease resistance.
## Basic concepts:
### Histone: 
It contains four type of Proteins are H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. A set of eight proteins are Histone Octamer.

### Chromatin:
A Substance within a chromosome consisting of DNA and protein. Changes in chromatin structure-associated with DNA replication and gene expression.
### Nucleosomes: 
It is Section of DNA contain 147 base pair. Fundamental subunit of chromatin wrapped around a core of proteins.

## Mechanisms Involved In Epigenetics 
### 1. DNA Methylation
### 2. Histone Modifications
### 3. RNA interference
## 1. DNA Methylation
The addition of a methyl group to the cytosine bases of DNA to form 5- Methylcytosine by Methyltransferase.
### Process of DNA Methylation:
### DNA Methylation
- Transcriptional gene silencing (TGS)
- Maintaining genome integrity by silencing transposable elements (TEs).
### De novo methylation: 
It occurs through small RNAs, termed RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and requires two plant-specific RNA polymerases, Pol IV and Pol V. The role of small RNAs, including siRNA and miRNA, including gene expression regulation and transposon silencing. 
### Example:
- miRNAs have been involved in regulating the expression of NLRs in tomato and, also subsequently regulating the resistance response.

### Method to investigate DNA methylation:
- Mass spectrometry
- Methylation-SpecificPCR (MSP)
- Whole genome bisulfite sequencing
- HPCE assay
## 2. HISTONE MODIFICATION:
- Addition of acetyl, methyl, and phosphate groups to the histone tails (N-terminal amino acids).
-	Alter the structure of chromatin, making genes accessible or inaccessible for transcription.
- Specific combinations of histone modifications (called histone code) control the transcriptional status of a chromatin region.
- Epigenetic modifications to the genome alter the spacing of nucleosomes and the availability of genes for transcription.
### Histone modification-
During histone acetylation transcription unblocked so gene can be transcribed and activated. But in histone deacetylation and methylation at the time transcription process can be blocked so gene can be silenced.

## 3.	NON-CODING RNAS OR RNA INTERFERENCE:
- In 1998, Fire and Mellow observed in Caenorthabditis elegans that dsRNA was the source of sequence-specific inhibition of protein expression, which they called “RNA interference”.
- Co-ordinated and reciprocal inactivation of the host gene and the transgene encoding the same RNA. This process has been called RNA silencing or RNA interference (RNAi).
### Mechanism:
- The cleavage of a dsRNA precursor into short (21-26 nucleotides) (nt) RNAs by an enzyme, Dicer, that has RNase III domains. These RNAs are known as short interfering RNAs (siRNA) and microRNAs (miRNAs).
- Both siRNA and miRNA are able to guide an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to destroy single-strand cognate RNA.
- Mature sRNAs associate with Argonaute (AGO) to form the core of the RNA-inducing silencing complex (RISC).
- sRNAs guide the RISC complex to complementary target RNA molecules. Finally, the silencing complex downregulates complementary RNA targets by either cleaving target mRNAs or repressing translation.
- MiRNA are 21-22 nt RNAs that are generated by DCL processing of premiRNAs. premiRNAs are single stranded ssRNAs transcribed from endogeneous plant genes that have extensive self complementary region so that they fold back on themselves to create a structured RNA that is recognized by the dsRNA cleaving DCL.
- premiRNA has made it possible to engineer artificial miRNA genes that will produce individual small RNAs of defined sequence.
- miRNAs are encoded by genes that produce hairpin-like RNA structures that are cleaved by DCLs(Dicer like protein) associated  by AGOs, mostly based on the size of sRNA as well as identity at 5′-nucleotide (nt), to form RISC complex that mediate post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) via sRNA-directed mRNA cleavage or translational repression
- RNA silencing has also been used in protecting crops from viral infection such as tomato leaf curl virus, potato virus X (PVX) and citrus tristeza virus (CTV)

- The epigenetic processes are involved in the responses of plants to pathogens and environmental stresses.
- Facilitated by genome-wide surveys in wild-type and mutant plants, new pathways integrating DNA methylation, histone modification, and siRNA production are being identified.
- Plant’s epigenome studies offers a great capacity in acclimatizing plant to various biotic and abiotic stresses.
- DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism for controlling innate immunity against microbial pathogens in plants.
## Future Prospects:
- Epigenetic mechanisms contribute to stress responses and memory in plants.
- Can be used to produce multiple diseases resistant  cultivars
- Epigenetics can improve the resilience of food crops by priming them with disease resistance.
